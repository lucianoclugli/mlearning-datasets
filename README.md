Datasets for Machine Learning implementing projects...

Dear candidate,
 
We appreciate the time on interview, the information exchanged and the direct contact.
 
As we need to evaluate the candidate's technical (practical) part, we came out a small and simple test for the candidates to implement a machine learning-based binary classifier.
 
The task is to build/program a simple binary classifier on apples and tomatoes from the datasets containing these two classes of images.
Please, refer to the link below for datasets retrieval.
https://github.com/lucianoclugli/mlearning-datasets
Note: '001.zip' file contains the apple images and '002.zip' file contains the tomatoes images.

Feel free to program with any machine learning method (supervised, unsupervised, DL) using any programming languages, packages, libraries, ...
 
Please, return us with the results in 7 days. It would be also nice give us a short description of results and algorithm in a report file.
 
*Any doubts regarding this task, please don't hesitate to contact.
 
 All the best,
Regards...
